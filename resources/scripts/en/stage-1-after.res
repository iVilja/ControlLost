B,"——Ten years ago, Lan and I were slaves in this mine."
B,"At that time, I was in charge of digging and she picked stones what I dug out."
B,No one knows what we were working for. There were nothing but endless tasks.
B,"If it weren't for that rebellion, we'd probably still be here digging useless rocks day in and day out."
B,"Of course more likely - Lan did not hold up. Her body would be hastily buried in a random piece of rubble, and I wouldn't be any better."
B,"Anyway, we're back, as mercenaries."
B,We were commissioned to find a stone.
B,The employer didn't tell us what kind of stone it was that was worth hiring the top ten bidding mercenaries on the continent.
B,But I know exactly what the stone is.
