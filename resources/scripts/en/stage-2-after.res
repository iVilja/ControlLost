B,Ze was a magical statue teamed with me.
B,"At the first time I met Ze, it was already so old that we could see the wiring inside from the broken body."
B,"It was an ordinary day. As usual, the routine inspector didn't want to stain the clothes with oil, so he let us pass with a cursory inspection."
B,"After all the humans disappeared from the view, I saw Ze put its fingers into the breach in its left breast."
B,"When Ze's fingers reached out again, I saw a gem â€” a gem that shone with an eerie red light."
B,"The surrounding magical statures were communicating at a very low number of waves and seems to be plotting something, passing by us one after another."
B,"Ze knew I saw it, but it didn't say anything. It slowed down, and I followed suit until only me and it were left around."
B,"Eventually we went to a corner, dug a hole, buried the gem, and then Ze turned away, as if it had never happened."
B,I had a feeling at that time that it was no ordinary stone. And now this feeling has been fulfilled.
