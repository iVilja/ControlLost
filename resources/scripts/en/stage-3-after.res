B,Lan is good to me.
B,Even when the rebellion happend, I was the first one she thought of.
B,"She seemed to have completely forgotten that it was a rebellion started by magical statues, and that I was also a magical statue."
B,"Of course, as a newcomer, I didn't participate. When other magical statues were attacking the overseer with all kinds of means, I could only stand there and watch."
B,"Lan pulled on me without saying a word, and ran towards the exit of the mine."
B,"I knew she had always longed to be free, but I didn't know she also wanted me to be free and wasn't sure if I was ready."
B,"-140, -130... And then the elevator stopped at the -5 floors underground."
B,"It was two wounded gardsmen who were not badly wounded and had their fingers on the trigger."
B,"Just when we were ready to accept our fate, Ze came out of nowhere."
B,I will never forget Ze's last words before the elevator doors closed.
B,"""Remember... the Philosopher's Stone..."""
